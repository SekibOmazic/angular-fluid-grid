angular-fluid-grid
==================

This project started as a fork of the awesome <a href="https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster">angular-gridster</a>. 
The jQuery/jQuery-UI dependencies have been removed and some bugs have been fixed. Some features I needed in my own project will also be implemented.

Tested with FF, Chrome, Safari on OSX and FF, Chrome, IE9 on Windows7.
